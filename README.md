## Summary
The weather in June compared to the weather in December seems to vary, however, both months in my opinion, would have a good weather conditions for surfing. 

### Additional Queries to gather more weather data for June and December

It would nice to gather more data to get further information. For example, 

- If we can query the temperature based on the station location, we would know which station will be a petter location for the shop

- We could also create a query to get precipitation information to determine whether it plays a factor despite the warm temperatures that are experienced during this time.
